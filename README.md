### Task-1 Optical-Character-Recognition

In this task,i have created character detector which extracts printed or handwritten text from image or video.
I used here OpenCV and EasyOCR.
EasyOCR containing three types of information:text element,it's bounding box vertices and the confidence level of the text detection.
OpenCV is used for overlay images with respective recognized text.
Matplotlib library is used for display images and numpy library is used for convert images into arrays.
